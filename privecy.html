    </p>
    <h3>ACTIVE INFORMATION</h3>
    <p> When ordering or registering on our Site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your: name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number or credit card information. You may, however, visit our site anonymously. In providing this Active Information, you consent and agree that you may be contacted by Cab4all.com with respect to information related to the Site and/or information regarding our or third parties’ products and services. If you provide personally identifiable data to us, you may later elect to have that information deleted from our files, or kept from being used for purposes other than for the service requested, by following the opt-out procedures set forth below.<br>
    </p>

    </p>
    <h3>USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our Site, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. Non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

We also use industry-accepted standards to protect your information, including SSL encryption when transmitting sensitive information. We have implemented certain physical, encrypted, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. Communications you may have with us via email or mail may not be secure unless we advise you that security measures are in place prior to your sending information.
